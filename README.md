Key Findings
Retailer Insights

A few retailers contribute a majority of total sales, showing high dependence on key partners.

Some retailers show high volume but low profitability, suggesting heavy discounting or dominance of low-priced SKUs.

Certain retailers outperform in specific brands, highlighting brand–retailer alignment opportunities.

Regional Insights

The West region is the strongest performer with the highest overall sales and strong brand contribution.

The South region shows high dominance of a single brand, indicating concentrated demand patterns.

The Northeast and Southeast regions rely heavily on specific brands, showing unstable brand diversity.

Monthly Insights

Peak months: June, July, December — driven by summer demand and holiday season.

Low months: February, March, April — consistent seasonal dips.

Sales spikes match increases in unit sales, confirming seasonal consumption behavior across beverages.

Brand contribution fluctuates month-to-month, indicating changing consumer preferences throughout the year.

Recommendations
1. Strengthen High-Performing Regions

Allocate more inventory, marketing spend, and promotional campaigns to West and Northeast regions to maximize returns.

2. Improve Distribution in Weaker Regions

Boost retailer onboarding and visibility in underperforming states within the South and Midwest.

3. Optimize Retailer Mix

Focus on improving the product mix for retailers showing high unit sales but low revenue.

Introduce premium or higher-margin SKUs in such outlets.

4. Seasonal Inventory Planning

Increase supply during June–July–December to capture peak demand.

Offer promotions or bundles during low-sales months to reduce dips.

5. Brand Strategy Alignment

Promote weaker brands in regions where brand concentration is high.

Expand the availability of strong brands (e.g., FizzySip in the West) across new territories.
