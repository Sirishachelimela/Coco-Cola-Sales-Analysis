Retailer Insights

A small number of retailers contribute a major share of total sales, indicating dependency on key partners.

Some retailers generate high volume but low profitability, suggesting heavy discounting or low-margin products.

Certain retailers outperform in specific brands, highlighting opportunities for brand–retailer alignment.

Regional Insights

The West region is the strongest performer with the highest total sales and strong brand contribution.

The South region shows dominance of a single brand, indicating concentrated demand patterns.

The Northeast and Southeast rely heavily on specific brands, leading to limited brand diversity.

Monthly Insights

Peak months: June, July, December — driven by summer demand and holiday season.

Low sales months: February, March, April — consistent seasonal dips.

Sales spikes closely align with unit sales, confirming seasonal beverage consumption behavior.

Brand contribution fluctuates month-to-month, indicating shifting consumer preferences.

Recommendations
1. Strengthen High-Performing Regions

Increase inventory allocation and marketing investment in the West and Northeast regions.

Leverage strong regional demand to maximize revenue returns.

2. Improve Distribution in Weaker Regions

Enhance retailer onboarding in underperforming states within the South and Midwest.

Increase product visibility and distribution reach in low-performing areas.

3. Optimize Retailer Product Mix

Improve product assortment for retailers with high units sold but low revenue.

Introduce premium and higher-margin SKUs to boost profitability.

4. Seasonal Inventory Planning

Increase supply during June–July–December to capture peak demand.

Use promotions, bundles, or discounts during low-demand months to reduce dips.

5. Brand Strategy Alignment

Promote weaker brands in regions dominated by a single brand.

Expand strong-performing brands (e.g., FizzySip in the West) into new territories.
