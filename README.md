🔍 Key Insights & Findings
🏪 Retailer Insights

A small set of retailers contributes a significant share of total sales, indicating reliance on key partners.

Some retailers show high volume but low profitability, suggesting heavy discounting or low-margin product mix.

Certain retailers perform exceptionally well for specific brands, presenting opportunities for targeted brand-retailer alignment.

🌍 Regional Insights

The West region is the strongest performer with the highest total sales and diversified brand contribution.

The South region is dominated by a single brand, indicating concentrated demand patterns.

The Northeast and Southeast regions rely heavily on select brands, limiting brand diversity.

📆 Monthly & Seasonal Insights

Peak months: June, July, and December — driven by summer consumption and holiday demand.

Low-sales months: February, March, and April — consistent seasonal downturns.

Sales spikes closely align with unit sales, confirming seasonal beverage consumption behavior.

Brand contribution fluctuates month-to-month, reflecting changing consumer preferences.

💡 Strategic Recommendations
1️⃣ Strengthen High-Performing Regions

Increase inventory allocation and marketing investment in West and Northeast regions.

Leverage strong regional demand to maximize revenue returns.

2️⃣ Improve Distribution in Weaker Regions

Expand retailer onboarding in underperforming states within the South and Midwest.

Improve product visibility and distribution reach in low-performing markets.

3️⃣ Optimize Retailer Product Mix

Enhance assortment for retailers with high units sold but low revenue.

Introduce premium and higher-margin SKUs to improve profitability.

4️⃣ Seasonal Inventory Planning

Scale supply during June–July–December to capture peak demand.

Use promotions, bundles, and pricing strategies during low-demand months to minimize revenue dips.

5️⃣ Brand Strategy Alignment

Promote weaker brands in regions dominated by a single brand to balance brand mix.

Expand strong-performing brands (e.g., FizzySip in the West) into new territories.
